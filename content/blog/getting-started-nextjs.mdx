# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces powerful new features that make building web applications faster and more enjoyable. In this post, we'll explore the key concepts and get you up and running.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 brings several exciting improvements:

- **Turbopack**: A new Rust-based bundler that's significantly faster
- **Server Actions**: Simplified data mutations without API routes
- **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic rendering
- **Improved Performance**: Better caching and optimization strategies

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started is easy. First, create a new Next.js application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will scaffold a new project with all the modern defaults configured.

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is built on React Server Components and introduces a new way to structure your application:

- **app/** directory for your application routes
- **layout.tsx** for shared UI across routes
- **page.tsx** for unique page content
- **loading.tsx** for loading states

## Server Components vs Client Components

By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components. This means:

1. They run on the server
2. They can directly access backend resources
3. They don't add to the client JavaScript bundle

Use Client Components when you need:

- Interactive features (onClick, useState, etc.)
- Browser APIs
- Custom hooks

Simply add `'use client'` at the top of your file to make it a Client Component.

## Data Fetching

Next.js 14 makes data fetching simple with async/await in Server Components:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in web development. The combination of Server Components, improved performance, and developer experience makes it an excellent choice for your next project.
