During the time I was working on this portfolio site, I was watching Jodorowsky's *Dune* and was inspired by the scenes with Moebius' contributions to the (unmade) film.

## Who Was Moebius?

Jean Giraud (1938-2012) was a French artist, cartoonist, and writer who revolutionized the world of comics and visual storytelling. Working under two distinct personas, Jean Giraud for his Western comics and Moebius for his science fiction work, he created a body of work that continues to influence artists, filmmakers, and designers worldwide.

## The Moebius Art Style

What makes Moebius's work so distinctive and influential?

### Ligne Claire (Clear Line)

Moebius pioneered a refined version of the *ligne claire* technique:

- **Clean, precise linework** - Every line serves a purpose, creating clarity without sacrificing detail
- **Minimal shading** - Relying on line weight and composition rather than heavy shadows
- **Elegant simplicity** - Complex scenes rendered with deceptive ease

### Imaginative World Building

His science fiction landscapes were one of a kind.

- **Surreal yet believable** - Fantastical elements grounded in visual logic
- **Intricate detail** - Worlds filled with mechanical wonders and organic forms
- **Sense of scale** - Vast, epic compositions that invite exploration

### Fluid Composition

Moebius had an extraordinary ability to guide the eye:

- **Dynamic panel layouts** - Breaking traditional comic conventions
- **Negative space** - Using emptiness as powerfully as detail
- **Rhythmic flow** - Visual storytelling that feels musical

## The Moebius Philosophy

Beyond technique, Moebius embodied a creative philosophy worth emulating:

> "I wanted to create worlds where anything was possible, where the only limit was imagination."

This mindset applies perfectly to software engineering and serves as a guiding principle for my career:

- **Push boundaries** - Don't accept "that's how it's always done"
- **Blend disciplines** - Combine art, technology, and storytelling
- **Stay curious** - Constantly explore new techniques and ideas
- **Serve the story (business)** - Every design choice should serve the user's journey
